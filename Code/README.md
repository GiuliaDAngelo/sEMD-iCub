The folder contains:

* **EccentricitysEMD.py**: eccentric down-sampling sEMD implementation. 

* **createFAKEstimuli.py**: This script allows you to create all the fake stimuli we used to characterise the system. 
You can define the camera resolution, the bar size, the speed and other parameters to get your desired events stream: eventsATIS_ON and eventsATIS_OFF.
Moreover, the script will create a folder where you can visualise your output immediately.
